# UI (optional, LLM-assisted)

Build a small dashboard that:

1. **Live display** — show events flowing through the system and scores being computed in real time.
2. **API interaction** — let users query the risk-engine API (look up scores, see statuses, etc.).

Use an LLM to help you build it fast. This is about showcasing your work and your API, not testing frontend skill.

Run it via `docker compose` or document how to start it.
